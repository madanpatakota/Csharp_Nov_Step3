    /*
 * 
An Exception is an unexpected issue that occurs in a program, preventing it from executing as intended. 
It can happen due to coding mistakes, system failures, or invalid user inputs, requiring correction to proceed

Types of Exceptions: Exceptions in C# can be of various types, such as System.Exception, System.ArgumentException, System.NullReferenceException, etc. Each exception type represents a specific kind of error that may occur during program execution.

Try-Catch Blocks: Exception handling in C# is typically done using try-catch blocks. The try block contains the code that may throw an exception, and the catch block handles the exception if one occurs.

  Syntax :
    try
    {
        // Code that may throw an exception
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // Handle the exception
        Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
    }
    finally{
     
    }
